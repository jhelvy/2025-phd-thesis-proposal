## Introduction {.smaller}

- **Unmanaged** BEV charging is becoming a problem to the grid.
- **Managed** charging is cheaper and smoothes out the grid load.
- **Smart** charging: Supplier-Managed Charging (SMC) and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G).

::: {.notes}
Unmanaged BEV charging is becoming a problem to the grid due to the spike. That's why we need managed charging to smoothes out the grid load as well as keep the price low.

Smart charging is a type of managed charging, which includes Supplier-Managed Charging, shortened as SMC, and Vehicle-to-Grid, shortened as V2G.

## SMC - Supplier Managed Charging

- SMC smooths out overnight EV charging demand.
- Electricity demand is controlled below capacity threshold.
- It saves money and reduces pollution.

::: {.notes}
For SMC, Supplier-Managed Charging, it smooths out the overnight EV charging demand.

As you can see, with unmanaged charging, the BEV load easily passes over the capacity threshold.

## SMC - Supplier Managed Charging

- SMC smooths out overnight EV charging demand.
- Electricity demand is controlled below capacity threshold.
- It saves money and reduces pollution.

::: {.notes}
But with SMC, the electricity demand is controlled below the threshold. It reduces the peak demand and saves money.
:::

## V2G - Vehicle-to-Grid

::: {.notes}
V2G is short for Vehicle-to-Grid. It is another type of smart charging that allows BEV owners to sell electricity back to the grid. With V2G, BEVs become potential sources of electricity.

## Research Contributions

- **Study 1:** First *large N* study of consumer sensitivities to smart charging. Introduces *attribute equivalencies* for incentive design.
- **Study 2:** Quantifies supply curves for *peak-shaving*, considering regions, seasons, EV-to-house ratios, and enrollment rates.
- **Study 3:** `surveydown`, a free open-source survey platform for programmable, reproducible survey designs.

I start with a survey research on smart charging, followed by a nation-wide grid simulation, and a survey software.

I hope these studies could benefit sustainable transportation, and give persistent contributions for future research.
