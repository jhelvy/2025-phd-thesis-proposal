## Introduction {.smaller}

**Background:**

- Electrified transportation reduces GHG emissions and fossil fuel use.
- BEV adoption creates new electricity demand that must be managed.

**The Challenge:**

- Charging timing can strain grid or provide flexibility services.
- Gaps in understanding: consumer preferences, program design, cost-effectiveness.

**This Dissertation:**

Combines consumer research, systems analysis, and methodological innovation to address these gaps.

## Three Interconnected Studies

**Study 1:** Consumer preferences for SMC and V2G programs (N=1,356 BEV owners).

**Study 2:** Cost-effectiveness framework for SMC programs with realistic enrollment costs.

**Study 3:** **surveydown**—open-source platform for complex, reproducible surveys.

## Research Contributions

- **Study 1:** Quantifies preferences of 1,356 BEV owners—SMC participants value flexibility and recurring payments; V2G supporters prefer monetary incentives.

- **Study 2:** Develops cost-effectiveness framework showing peak load will be largely shaved and grids benefit from reduced costs during low-demand periods.

- **Study 3:** Introduces **surveydown**, an open-source platform enabling programmable, reproducible surveys for complex research.

**Conclusion:** Together, these studies inform utility program design and policy development, advancing both BEV grid integration and transportation electrification research methods.
