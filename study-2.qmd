## Research Questions {style="line-height: 2;"}

1. **Peak-shaving**: How are supply curves quantified to achieve peak-shaving?

2. **Variations:** How do peak-shaving results change based on regions, seasons, EV-to-house ratios, and enrollment rates.

## Plan of Action {.smaller}

### Step 1: Data Collection {style="font-size: 32px; color: #739C69;"}
- **NHTS** trip data: EV usage and charging patterns
- **NREL** Cambium data: Household electricity consumption
- **U.S. Census**: Count of single family households
- **Study 1**: MXL model of SMC enrollment utilities

### Step 2: Simulation {style="font-size: 32px; color: #739C69;"}
- Original grid consumption profiles
- A variety of peak-shaved grid consumption profiles

### Step 3: Sensitivity Analysis {style="font-size: 32px; color: #739C69;"}
- Compare the peak-shaving results of different scenarios.
- Summarize and provide policy implications.

## Original Consumption Profile {.light-centered}

## Shifted Consumption with Peak-shaving {.light-centered}

![](/figs/study-2/caiso_profile_2.png){fig-align="center" width=85% .purple-border}

::: {style="font-size: 32px;"}
60% SMC enrollment, EV-to-house ratio 1:4.

## MXL Model of Monthly Incentives {.light-centered}

![](/figs/study-2/smc_monthly_sens_plot.png){fig-align="center" width="90%" .purple-border}

## EV Peak Increase <span style="color: #ED6D46;">vs</span> Monthly Incentives

![](/figs/study-2/ev_peak_increase_and_cost.png){fig-align="center" width="85%" .purple-border}

::: {style="font-size: 32px;"}
More incentives lead to higher SMC enrollment, thus more peak shaving.
:::

## Sensitivity Analysis {.dark-centered .center}

## Different Scenarios {.light-centered .center}

- All 18 GEA regions in all 4 seasons.
- Varying EV-to-house ratios (1:4, 1:2, 1:1).
- Varying SMC enrollment rates (from 0% to 100%).
- Varying peak-shaving "from" and "to" windows.

## Policy Implications {.light-centered .center}

1. Utilities must plan a budget that scales with enrollment levels.
2. Governments could provide subsidies to offset the cost.
