## Continuing from Study 1... {.smaller}

- Benefits of smart charging are limited by different factors.
- Smart charging programs should be cost-effective.
- For utilities: costs for generation and incentives.
- For EV owners: compromising mobility in exchange for incentives.

## Research Questions {style="line-height: 2;"}

1. What are the cost-benefit trade-offs for utilities implementing these programs?

2. How do these trade-offs vary across different locations?

## Plan of Action

### Step 1: Data Collection
- EV charging from **NHTS** trip date
- Household electricity consumption from **NREL** Cambium data
- Count of single family households from **U.S. Census**
- SMC enrollment rates vs incentives from **Study 1**

### Step 2: Simulation
- Original consumption profile
- Shifted consumption profile with peak-shaving

### Step 3: Cost-Benefit Analysis
- For utilities: if electricity generation savings outweigh the incentives offered
- For EV owners: the sweet point between mobility compromise and incentives

## Data Collection - NHTS Trip Data

- 2022 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS).
- 300,000+ households, 150,000+ vehicles.
- Trip-level data: start/end time, distance, purpose, etc.

## Simulated EV Charging Profile

## Data Collection - NREL Electricity Consumption

- 2024 Cambium Scenario Data by NREL.
- Hourly U.S. grid projections through 2050.
- Includes emissions, costs, and generation mix across scenarios.

## 18 GEA Regions

## CAISO as an Example

- 7.69M single families, collected from U.S. Census.

## Simulation - Original Consumption Profile

![](/figs/study-2/caiso_profile_1.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

## Simulation - Shifted Consumption Profile

- 25% EV ownership. 60% SMC enrollment.
- Peak-shaving from 10AM-12:00AM to 12:00AM-7AM.
- Override enabled: if SMC will fail the trip, no shifting.

## Simulation in Progress...

- All 18 GEA regions.
- Varying EV ownership rates (25%, 50%, 100%).
- Varying SMC enrollment rates (from 0% to 100%).
- Varying peak-shaving "from" and "to" windows.

## Cost-Benefit of Utilities

**Costs** on incentives should be smaller than **savings** on reduced generation during valley hours.

## Sensitivity Analysis of Monthly Incentives

- A rough MNL (Multinomial Logit) model analysis based on Study 1 results.
- Will shift to MXL (Mixed Logit) model.

## EV Peak Increase Shaving vs Monthly Incentives

- More incentives lead to higher SMC enrollment, thus more peak shaving.

## Upcoming Work...

- Finish simulations across all GEA regions.
- Finalize MXL model for SMC enrollment rates.
- Complete cost-benefit analysis for utilities and EV owners.
- Prepare manuscript for submission.
